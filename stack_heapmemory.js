//memory control in javascript
//stack and heap memory

//stack memory is used for static memory allocation : copy of values, function calls, local variablesr
//heap memory is used for dynamic memory allocation : referenceof objects, functions, arrays

//stack memory is used for primitive data types : number, string, boolean, null, undefined, symbol, bigint
//heap memory is used for non-primitive data types : object, function, array

//stack memory is faster than heap memory
//stack memory is used for primitive data types
//heap memory is used for non-primitive data types :object, function, array 

//stack memory is automatically managed by the JavaScript engine
//heap memory is manually managed by the developer
